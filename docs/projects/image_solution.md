# images solution

# img and object-position and object-fit

you have an image that needs to fit its content box without losing the aspect

via CSS background-image and give it the background-size: cover property. 
```css
background-size: cover
background-image
```

inline images and style them in CSS with object-fit and object-position instead.
# css spirtes

get the image once, and shift it around and only display parts of it. This reduces the overhead of having to fetch multiple images.
