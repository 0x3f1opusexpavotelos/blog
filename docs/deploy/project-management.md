## Project management

### CLI

Use our CLI to develop your project locally and deploy to the Supabase Platform. [Docs](/docs/reference/cli).

### Management API

Manage your projects programmatically. [Docs](/docs/reference/api).

## Client libraries

Official client libraries for [JavaScript](/docs/reference/javascript/start), [Flutter](/docs/reference/dart/initializing) and [Swift](/docs/reference/swift/introduction).
Unofficial libraries are supported by the community.

## Feature status

Supabase Features are in 4 different states - Private Alpha, Public Alpha, Beta and Generally Available.

### Private alpha

Features are initially launched as a private alpha to gather feedback from the community. To join our early access program, send an email to product-ops@supabase.io.

### Public alpha

The alpha stage indicates that the API might change in the future, not that the service isnâ€™t stable. Even though the [uptime Service Level Agreement](https://supabase.com/sla) does not cover products in Alpha, we do our best to have the service as stable as possible.

### Beta

Features in Beta are tested by an external penetration tester for security issues. The API is guaranteed to be stable and there is a strict communication process for breaking changes.

### Generally available

In addition to the Beta requirements, features in GA are covered by the [uptime SLA](https://supabase.com/sla).
