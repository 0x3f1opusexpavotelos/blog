## material types

 there are only three ways that light can reflect off a surface, which we'll call 

- diffuse(漫反射)

rough surfaces, where an incoming ray of light scatters in all directions

> - carpet, cloth 地毯、布料
> - dirt, rough rock  泥土、粗糙的岩石
> - dry grass  干草

-  specular（镜面反射）

These are smooth, shiny surfaces, where an incoming ray of light might bounce, mirror-like, and proceed on

> - plastic 塑料
> - metal  金属
> - polished leather  抛光皮革

- translucent: （半透明）

These are surfaces that transmit as well as reflect light

> - water 水
> - glass 玻璃
> - soap bubbles 肥皂泡

The modeling of diffuse reflection of light has the brightness of the surface computed by *Lambert's cosine law*. 

The modeling of specular reflection uses a model by Bui Tuong Phong and so is called the [Phong reflection model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model).
