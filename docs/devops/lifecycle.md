## software release life cycle

`pre-alpha`: think up what should have in it, and  how they will do it
alpha 

- research 
  require analysis, target audience what will make the software useful and who will want to use it.
- planning 
  how long it might take to get it done. Create timelines and milestones.
  technology stack, infra and tools preparation
- design  will look like and how users will interact with it.

`alpha`: is a computer program that can do most of what the programmers want it to do

`beta`: refine the software as much as possible.
invite/shared with a select group of users who fit the target market
feedback is crucial for identifying any unseen bugs, how the software meets user needs
improving the software based on this feedback to ensure it’s as good as it can be.

`rc(release candidate)`: ready for a wider audience.

`rtm (release to manufacturing)`: is a publication of a product which is ready for replication, the focus shifts to marketing and distributing the software,

- Locale of content to different languages,
- Arranging licenses for international distribution,
- And third-party certification

`pr(production Release)`:  support for the release
Regular updates that maintain the software’s smooth operation.
Long-term support versions for users who want the reassurance that their software will stay consistent over time.


Onboarding new users and helping them get the most out of the product,
