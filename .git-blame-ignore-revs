# The git blame command works by iterating through a file's change history to determine who last modified each line.
# However, some adjustments, lke formatting and style changes might obscure underlying functional changes. This is where ignoring specific revisions becomes useful.
# to ignore or bypass certain commits to attribute.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
# You can set this file as a default ignore file for blame by running
# the following command.
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs


# reorganize folder structure
